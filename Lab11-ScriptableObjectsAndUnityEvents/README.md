In the assignment I use both scriptable objects and unity events to make a functional scoring system in my game. The debugger scriptable object and script was used for troubleshooting that process.

Behaviours:
  Trigger Event Behaviour - manages scriptable objects and establishes how they trigger
  
Scriptable Object Scripts:
  Debugger - used to troubleshoot through issues
  Float Data - creates a float scriptable object
  Int Data - creates an integer scriptable object
  Score - houses the score information
  String Data- creates a string scriptable object

Scriptable Objects:
Debugger - used to troubleshoot through issues
Final Score - where the high score int data is housed
Score Action - where the score trigger is housed
Score Data - where the score int data is housed
SpawnerStats - this is where the spawner editable information is housed
