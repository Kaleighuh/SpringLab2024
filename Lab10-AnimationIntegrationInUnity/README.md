In this file, there are two characters that have been rigged using Unity's rigging system. Leo and OIIO. Leo is rigged but is not animated in this file. OIIO is rigged and animated using Unity's state machines.

I plan to use OIIO in my Honors Contract game this sememster - using the rig but redoing the animation. Since this particular animation was done a year ago. And I have learned a lot since then.
